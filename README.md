# YPDL-Identify-Handwritten-Digits-using-CNN-with-TensorFlow

## About the workshop

Recognizing handwritten numbers is a piece of cake for humans, but itâ€™s a non-trivial task for machines. Currently, however, with the advancement of machine learning, people have made machines more capable of performing this task.

In this second workshop of the Your Path to Deep Learning series, we will use MNIST Dataset to build two Neural Networks capable to perform handwritten digits classification. The first Network is a simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and the second one is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We will show you the step-by-step guide to create a simple handwritten digit recognizer in Watson Studio with TensorFlow.

### ðŸŽ“ What will you learn?

Create a project in Watson Studio and use Jupyter Notebook in the project.
Create a simple Multi-layer perceptron (Neural Network), to perform classification tasks.
Create a Deep Learning Neural Network and apply on MNIST.
